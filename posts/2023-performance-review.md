# Initial Commentary

This year, 2023, was the first year in which I have taken futures trading seriously, and managing my affairs as a trading business.
In the past, I'd treated it more casually, making trades when I had a strong opinion that I wanted to express in the market.
Some of these worked very well, some less so.
But I didn't have a consistent track record of what I was doing and what was working best for me.
This year, I wrote out a first draft of my trading plan, committed to tracking every trade, and went to work on developing my individual trading style.

This has been an overall good experience in my first full year of trading full time.  
I went through some tough times, and I also had some good times, but most importantly, I've learned a lot.
Both about myself, as well as about what works for me in the process of market speculation.
I've also been fortunate to come across several great resources that have helped me to improve.

# Monthly Returns

I'll start by listing my monthly returns, and calculating the monthly Gain to Pain ratio.
I want to be clear that this is only for my trading portfolio based on my Nominal Account Value.
One of the amazing things about Futures and Forex is the capital efficiency that you can enjoy.
Because of this, the actual capital deployed was only a small portion of my Nominal Account Value.

## Commentary

This year had a few different tones in terms of my trading performance.

The year began with fairly rough patch.
Of the first 25 tranches I closed this year, 22 were for a loss and 2 were breakeven with a single tranche closed for a small win of 78 bps.

After this challenging start, which went through more mental capital than actual trading capital, things took a turn in my favor as I caught a couple of rates trades that got me back into positive territory.
Then in May, I managed to find my way into a Soybean Meal short that was my biggest winning trade of the year.
It returned a profit of 493 bps.

Pretty much immediately after this trade, I started my most challenging period of the year.
I went through a drawdown that lasted for over 5 months.
I discuss dealing with drawdowns in my post on [Dealing with Drawdowns](/posts/dealing-with-drawdowns/).

This fall, I managed to catch quite a few moves across a few different assets: from the year end rally in the Nasdaq, the turn in US Treasuries, and the breakout in Crypto.
This led to my largest monthly gain in November.
December has been mostly flat in terms of closed trades, but I'm carrying some open positions with *Unrealized Profits* into 2024.

# Trade Statistics

If you need a review of the trading statistics that I think are important, head over to my article on the [Trading Triangle](/posts/trading-triangle/) as I won't be going into detail on calculating them here.

### Considerations on Trade Window Aperture

Since most of my trades last anywhere from a couple of days to several months, I have to determine how to group trades into a given trading window.
In most situations, I am looking at my trade close date as my date of record, as that is the moment which the profit or loss is actually realized.
Each tranche closed could just be a partial closure of a position as well, but that doesn't impact this way of looking at my trades.
This is the method used to generate my monthly returns listed at the start of this post.
It does not take into account any unrealized or open profits in positions that remain open going into the next month or year.
It only looks at the moment in which the profit or loss was realized.

Note that this is different than how the IRS views futures trading.
They look at your mark to market performance as of the end of the year.

For my trade statistics, I like to group my trades based on entry, with the cumulative gain or loss for all closed tranches as the gain of loss for that entry, even if portions of it were exited at different times.
I think this gives the best view into what is my actual risk / reward for putting the trade on, and what is my actual expectancy for trades that I place.  
For this *Trade Statistics* section, I'll be looking at that I've opened during 2023, with the total gain or loss on that position.
For a few trades that are either fully, or partially open going into 2024, I'll use their year-end mark to market gain.
