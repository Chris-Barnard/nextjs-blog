The reality of trading is that a large portion of your time will be spent in some form of drawdown.
In this post, I will take a look at my closed trades this year through the end of November.
As November ended, I closed out the month at a new equity high.
November saw me finally clawing my way out of my deepest and longest drawdown of the year.

### Trade Graphs

Let's start by taking a look at my Equity Curve as well as my Drawdown Graph.

It is very clear in looking at the Drawdown Graph that the vast majority of the year was spent in some form of drawdown.
In fact, there were 7 different drawdowns that were completed throughout the course of the year.

### Drawdown Breakdown

Below is a table of the individual drawdowns, listed in the order in which they occurred.

When looked at this way, a few things stand out:
 - There were four drawdowns that lasted more than a month.
 - Three drawdowns were more than 100 bps.
 - The worst drawdown lasted over 5 months.
 - There were very few days between one drawdown ending and another beginning.  Sometimes even on the same or next day.

## Approaching Drawdowns

### Mental Game

#### Setting Your Expectations

When you see that something like 95% of the time, that I'm in some kind of drawdown from my *Equity All Time High*, does it make you cringe a little?
This desire not to lose, has to be overcome if you want to succeed at this game.
Expect to have losing trades.
Embrace it even.
By focusing on how to handle and manage your losing trades you're focusing on the building blocks of a long-term profitable strategy.

#### Journal Your Mistakes

Every trader makes mistakes.
By this I don't mean losing trades, but actual mistakes.
This could be not following your trading plan, or some gap in your current knowledge of your trading strategy.
These are moments to take notes about the mistake, and the events, thoughts and emotions leading up to it.
In Jared Tendler's [(@jaredtendler)](https://twitter.com/jaredtendler) **The Mental Game of Trading**, he refers to this as Data Collection.

Journaling my mistakes helps to not only better understand my own psychology and how it's impacting my decision making in my trading, but it also helps me to separate out the trades I'm executing at my A or B game level vs my C game level.
This gives me confidence in spots I'm executing well, but my drawdown is getting deeper, or it's taking a long time to get out.
It helps me to focus on my process.

It also helps with recognizing patterns that are repeating that result in me making mistakes.  For instance, I've noticed a tendency to get over confident after my big wins, or series of winning trades.
My large 5% drawdown began just after closing my largest gain for the year.
I was over confident and sized too large on a couple of trades trying to hit another home run, instead of focusing on my risk and keeping the balanced mindset that most of my trades are either breakeven or a loss.
It took me 5 months to climb back out of the hole I started digging with a couple of greedy trades.

#### Focus On What You Can Control

Focus on your process.
What markets you're trading, where you are entering and exiting trades. 
How you are making those decisions.


### Tactics

Here I want to talk about tactics and strategy for handling drawdowns.
