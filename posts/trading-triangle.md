Understanding the math of your trading is paramount to developing a trading plan that you can expect earn money over time, or that has a positive expectation.  There are three variables that are critical to measure and track to understand how your trading strategy is performing.

Renowned market wizard Mark Minervini refers to these three variables as the Trading Triangle. This post is dedicated to not only explaining what these variables are, but also some very insightful metrics that can be calculated from these.

## The Trading Triangle
 - Win Percentage
 - Average Win
 - Average Loss

The reason I think it's helpful to think of these variables as a triangle is to understand that they are all interconnected.  If you attempt to change your **Win Percentage**, it will undoubtedly affect your **Average Wins** and **Losses**

### Win Percentage
Most newer traders are overly focused on their win percentage.  In and of itself, it is a fairly meaningless statistic, but when taken in context of the other two variables, it starts to paint a picture of your performance.
The **Win Percentage** is simply the percentage of your total trades that were profitable.

The reason I say that this stat by itself is fairly meaningless, is because you could have a **Win Percentage** of 90%, but if you achieved that by stubbornly holding onto to losing trades, refusing to recognize a loss, you might could end up with an **Average Loss** that is so large relative to your **Average Win** that you aren't profitable in the long run.

On the other hand, it's entirely possible to have a **Win Percentage** below 50%, but if you are winning more on your winning trades than your losing trades, you could be trading a profitable strategy.

### Average Win and Average Loss
The **Average Win** is the average amount of profit, across all of your profitable trades, while the **Average Loss** is the average amount lost across all of your losing and break even trades.

While it is fairly straightforward to understand these metrics in and of themselves, the insights really come when you start to see the relationships between each of these variables.
